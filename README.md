## Installation

Before running the application, you need to configure your hosts file with the add-on's hostname. You'll also need to create an SSL key pair for this domain.

It's also recommended to install [Volta](https://volta.sh/) in order to use the correct versions of node.js and npm.

```shell
# Add 
127.0.0.1       {hostname from .env}` (replace everything including the {})  to `/etc/hosts`

# Execute
npm ci

# !! Make sure you have openssl installed on your computer for this step. !! 
# Generate a ssl certificates with the following command. The domain name (aka hostname) is retrieved from `CONFIG_SERVER_HOST` in `.env`. 
npm run generate:ssl
```
